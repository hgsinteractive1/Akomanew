I thought this was my final semester in b-school, what’s all this work coming at me about? Someone must have been smoking the green stuff when they claimed this would be an easy semester, because it is pretty evident that my professors are intent on making my behind work like an animal this semester.I’m still going to Brazil and Argentina, that’s for real (ended up having a ball in South America). I don’t care if I have a midterm the day after spring break.</p><p>So it seems a lot has happened while we all took off and did the do during the holidays (wrote this right after the elections). Now, we have an MBA as the president of the country. I’m not necessarily jumping up for joy, I mean, this puts the MBA crowd in the spotlight and it doesn’t make it any better that he’s from Harvard. We all know their work ethic, so if Dubya blows the economy or screws up the country’s fiscal policy, then MBA recruiters are going to start re-evaluating their relationships with business schools. Now, if he was a Stern MBA, with a couple of courses with Messrs. Smith and Yermack, then I would feel a lot more confident (ok, so it gets a little competitive amongst b-schools, that's why MBAs are such a sorry bunch). We’ll watch and see, G.W. Don’t go starting a war with Hawaii (yes it is one of the 50 states, Dubya) or Puerto Rico when stuff hits the fan, you better dig into your “Conflicts and Negotiations” textbook and handle your business, boy (wow, it's almost like I knew this bobo would start something...damn!!).</p><p>So I had an interesting vacation. I’m sitting at home, watching TV when I got a phone call from my mother in Nigeria . We talked for a little bit, y’know, I missed her, she missed me, my grandfather (Pimp Daddy Extraordinaire) was married (he's about 95 years old...I want to be like him when I grow up. Pimp Daddy!!)…y’know, the good stuff.</p><p>Then she got silent.“Mama,” I inquired, “are you alright?” Now, in most African cultures, once your parents or elders take a long pause (the pauses have gradually increased as the wedding day gets nearer) when they are speaking to you, your ass is about to get toasted. Dunked on. Plastered. I heard her exhale on the other end. “Chidi, my son,” she started. My heart did a triple axle-trifecta-double-pumped somersault. I popped two Levitra...sorry, two Tylenol extra strength in anticipation of the migraines headed my way via the phone line.</p><p>She continued, “I am proud of you. I am really proud of you. You are about to graduate with an MBA and you are the envy of many of your friends back home in Nigeria (actually, no envy whatsoever. The fact is, I didn't become a doctor. That signals failure. If you are a young Nigerian in the States and you are not a doctor or pharmacist, you have failed the Igbo Nation. You are required to denounce you Igbohood sixty days after failure). You have done well and God has blessed me with a first son like you.” She paused again.</p><p>Oh, boy.</p><p>Okay, now let me explain what she was doing here. This was a common technique used by our folks when serious topics where discussed. Let me use an anecdote to break it own for you. I attended boarding school in Nigeria. It was the best experience in my life; it was also the most harrowing six years any young man could live through on this planet (high school in Nigeria was just incredible. I have the scars to prove it). Oz? That is Disney World compared to boarding school in Nigeria. Anyways, when I was about fifteen, in Class 5 (which is equivalent to the junior year in high school), we had an occurrence of rat attacks. Yes, rat attacks. Fellas would wake up in the morning and discover parts of their toes missing. You would be sleeping in your corner and then get jolted awake by the piercing scream of some poor sonofabitch, whose pinkie toe was now half there, half gone. At first we thought that the spirits of Rumuokwuta were finally exacting justice upon the poor pinkie-less souls, but we had to investigate.</p><p>A nocturnal investigative team was formed to find out what was going on. I ran point on the team. What we saw shocked even myself, who had connections with the spirit world (we still talk, but we had a falling out. always scaring me half to death). At approximately ten to fifteen minutes after two in the morning, as we regaled each other with tales from the crypt, these humongous rats would come out of the woodworks, sneak into the dorm room and position themselves right at the juiciest feet on the lower bunk beds. Then they would nibble a bit on the toe, then blow softly on the toe to intercept and obliterate any pain signals going to the poor guy’s brain. Nibble, blow, nibble, blow (i swear!!). The poor guy wouldn’t feel a thing.</p><p>You see, I was getting the “nibble, blow” treatment from The Mama.</p><p>“So, my son. I need to ask you a question.” I popped two more Tylenols.</p><p>“When are you going to get married?”</p><p>Whoa. (yeah...like whoa!)</p><p>The Mama started tearing into me. “All your friends here in Nigeria have gotten married (every single one of them). I went to Okey’s wedding last week. In fact, Kelechi is about to have her second baby.”</p><p>I was speechless. Kelechi? Her second baby? Damn. She was fine, too. Now that’s someone I could have married (thank God I didn't. I heard she went psycho on her husband, and got a job).</p><p>“Well…uh…Mama…y’see…” I was stuttering like a Stern MBA at a Bain interview.</p><p>“Don’t you ‘well…uh’ me. Look, you are old enough to father as many children as the head cockerel on our compound (true, true). Tell me, Chidi, what are you waiting for, eh?” (uh, graduation? A job? Some money? How about a woman?) The Mama was getting heated and I was not helping by cowering on the other end of the line. I had to mount a strong defense.</p><p>“But, Mama,” I countered, “I am going to school. I have no money, I don’t even have a job, what woman would want a broke man like me. I can’t even buy water.” Now, that was a good counter-attack.</p><p>“Shaaarrraaappp, you idiot”, The Mama bellowed into the phone. “What do you mean you are broke, eh?

I fed her all that stuff so she could feel like this MBA thing was a good idea. Now she was using it against me. And there was no way I was going to start explaining that the economy was “receding” some of those freaking gazillion, pravillion dollar offers. My mother is brilliant.

Sorry, the Ngozi)?</p><p>The Mama then finished with one of her patented concluding statements. “Why don’t you come home in May and visit me? And you can also meet these girls, you might like one of them. I also have some presents that I have bought for you…actually, my friends bought them for you. Chidi, you know I love you, right?“</p><p>Nibble, blow, nibble, blow.</p>","html":"<p>Well, it's time to get this party started once again this semester…I’m sitting in disbelief at the amount of stuff I have due next week. I thought this was my final semester in b-school, what’s all this work coming at me about? Someone must have been smoking the green stuff when they claimed this would be an easy semester, because it is pretty evident that my professors are intent on making my behind work like an animal this semester.I’m still going to Brazil and Argentina, that’s for real (ended up having a ball in South America). I don’t care if I have a midterm the day after spring break.</p><p>So it seems a lot has happened while we all took off and did the do during the holidays (wrote this right after the elections). Now, we have an MBA as the president of the country. I’m not necessarily jumping up for joy, I mean, this puts the MBA crowd in the spotlight and it doesn’t make it any better that he’s from Harvard. We all know their work ethic, so if Dubya blows the economy or screws up the country’s fiscal policy, then MBA recruiters are going to start re-evaluating their relationships with business schools. Now, if he was a Stern MBA, with a couple of courses with Messrs. Smith and Yermack, then I would feel a lot more confident (ok, so it gets a little competitive amongst b-schools, that's why MBAs are such a sorry bunch). We’ll watch and see, G.W. Don’t go starting a war with Hawaii (yes it is one of the 50 states, Dubya) or Puerto Rico when stuff hits the fan, you better dig into your “Conflicts and Negotiations” textbook and handle your business, boy (wow, it's almost like I knew this bobo would start something...damn!!).</p><p>So I had an interesting vacation. I’m sitting at home, watching TV when I got a phone call from my mother in Nigeria . We talked for a little bit, y’know, I missed her, she missed me, my grandfather (Pimp Daddy Extraordinaire) was married (he's about 95 years old...I want to be like him when I grow up. Pimp Daddy!!)…y’know, the good stuff.</p><p>Then she got silent.“Mama,” I inquired, “are you alright?” Now, in most African cultures, once your parents or elders take a long pause (the pauses have gradually increased as the wedding day gets nearer) when they are speaking to you, your ass is about to get toasted. Dunked on. Plastered. I heard her exhale on the other end. “Chidi, my son,” she started. My heart did a triple axle-trifecta-double-pumped somersault. I popped two Levitra...sorry, two Tylenol extra strength in anticipation of the migraines headed my way via the phone line.</p><p>She continued, “I am proud of you. I am really proud of you. You are about to graduate with an MBA and you are the envy of many of your friends back home in Nigeria (actually, no envy whatsoever. The fact is, I didn't become a doctor. That signals failure. If you are a young Nigerian in the States and you are not a doctor or pharmacist, you have failed the Igbo Nation. You are required to denounce you Igbohood sixty days after failure). You have done well and God has blessed me with a first son like you.” She paused again.</p><p>Oh, boy.</p><p>Okay, now let me explain what she was doing here. This was a common technique used by our folks when serious topics where discussed. Let me use an anecdote to break it own for you. I attended boarding school in Nigeria. It was the best experience in my life; it was also the most harrowing six years any young man could live through on this planet (high school in Nigeria was just incredible. I have the scars to prove it). Oz? That is Disney World compared to boarding school in Nigeria. Anyways, when I was about fifteen, in Class 5 (which is equivalent to the junior year in high school), we had an occurrence of rat attacks. Yes, rat attacks. Fellas would wake up in the morning and discover parts of their toes missing. You would be sleeping in your corner and then get jolted awake by the piercing scream of some poor sonofabitch, whose pinkie toe was now half there, half gone. At first we thought that the spirits of Rumuokwuta were finally exacting justice upon the poor pinkie-less souls, but we had to investigate.</p><p>A nocturnal investigative team was formed to find out what was going on. I ran point on the team. What we saw shocked even myself, who had connections with the spirit world (we still talk, but we had a falling out. always scaring me half to death). At approximately ten to fifteen minutes after two in the morning, as we regaled each other with tales from the crypt, these humongous rats would come out of the woodworks, sneak into the dorm room and position themselves right at the juiciest feet on the lower bunk beds. Then they would nibble a bit on the toe, then blow softly on the toe to intercept and obliterate any pain signals going to the poor guy’s brain. Nibble, blow, nibble, blow (i swear!!). The poor guy wouldn’t feel a thing.</p><p>You see, I was getting the “nibble, blow” treatment from The Mama.</p><p>“So, my son. I need to ask you a question.” I popped two more Tylenols.</p><p>“When are you going to get married?”</p><p>Whoa. (yeah...like whoa!)</p><p>The Mama started tearing into me. “All your friends here in Nigeria have gotten married (every single one of them). I went to Okey’s wedding last week. In fact, Kelechi is about to have her second baby.”</p><p>I was speechless. Kelechi? Her second baby? Damn. She was fine, too. Now that’s someone I could have married (thank God I didn't. I heard she went psycho on her husband, and got a job).</p><p>“Well…uh…Mama…y’see…” I was stuttering like a Stern MBA at a Bain interview.</p><p>“Don’t you ‘well…uh’ me. Look, you are old enough to father as many children as the head cockerel on our compound (true, true). Tell me, Chidi, what are you waiting for, eh?” (uh, graduation? A job? Some money? How about a woman?) The Mama was getting heated and I was not helping by cowering on the other end of the line. I had to mount a strong defense.</p><p>“But, Mama,” I countered, “I am going to school. I have no money, I don’t even have a job, what woman would want a broke man like me. I can’t even buy water.” Now, that was a good counter-attack.</p><p>“Shaaarrraaappp, you idiot”, The Mama bellowed into the phone. “What do you mean you are broke, eh? Didn’t you tell me some of your classmates are being offered salaries of two hundred thousand dollars a year? (ok...so maybe I exagerrated a little bit there).

She was probably saying her final prayers. “If I survive this I will become a nun, please Lord”. The other lady next to me kept explaining with a heavy Danish accent that they were warned about our (in)famous Matatus. Unfortunately for them the driver was having a 'party of the lanes' much to her disgust. “This is very different from Odense”, she insisted.</span></font></p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 8px; color: rgb(77, 77, 77); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 18px; background-color: rgb(237, 239, 240);\">For those of us who are used to it, we will tell you that we have experienced a little bit of everything from our daily commutes. Near death experiences to ones that were more humorous than deadly, a run in with traffic police to meeting interesting people. I said meeting but I really meant staring. From fancy ones that have all kinds of graffiti, lights and loud music to the old has beens that need the tout to occasionally carry the door all by his lonesome. You cant escape using them.

Sometimes too much talent and egos battling to be on air can turn ugly, particularly if one reporter swoops down late in the game and ‘bigfoots’ the rest. But between the three of us, the dynamic was great as was the division of labor between the human toll story, newsgathering, and the investigation angle.</p><p>One of the women who died in the attack was a pregnant radio DJ. Victoria and I went to her funeral, in our private capacity. It was a Muslim funeral, at the Ismaili Mosque. Thousands of people had turned out to pay their respects. Everyone I met was in shock, trying to avoid looking at the tragic bump in her stomach, and processing terror close to home. Aria, our family hairdresser and friend, and her daughter Shivani were there and we were all moved to tears.</p><p>President Uhuru Kenyatta finally made a statement on TV that the siege was over. Minutes later I finished my last live, exhausted with no sleep for four days and walked to our van. The phone rang. It was State House, adding to information and clarifying details which Victoria and I wrote up and sent in to CNN wires.</p><p>After a strong drink, I finally drifted off to sleep for a few hours at a hotel in town. I vividly recall the image that night. I am sitting in a car leaving the crushed rooftop of Westgate one final time. In my hands are the only survivors that day from the mall. They are two Black Moor fish in a plastic bag filled urgently with water. They swim in circles, glancing at each other, eyewitnesses that will never tell.</p>","html":"<p>The crunch of shattered glass beneath my feet, the bullet holes in windows and the acrid smell of disaster enveloped me the moment I entered my favorite mall in Nairobi.

Sometimes too much talent and egos battling to be on air can turn ugly, particularly if one reporter swoops down late in the game and ‘bigfoots’ the rest. But between the three of us, the dynamic was great as was the division of labor between the human toll story, newsgathering, and the investigation angle.</p><p>One of the women who died in the attack was a pregnant radio DJ. Victoria and I went to her funeral, in our private capacity. It was a Muslim funeral, at the Ismaili Mosque. Thousands of people had turned out to pay their respects. Everyone I met was in shock, trying to avoid looking at the tragic bump in her stomach, and processing terror close to home. Aria, our family hairdresser and friend, and her daughter Shivani were there and we were all moved to tears.</p><p>President Uhuru Kenyatta finally made a statement on TV that the siege was over. Minutes later I finished my last live, exhausted with no sleep for four days and walked to our van. The phone rang. It was State House, adding to information and clarifying details which Victoria and I wrote up and sent in to CNN wires.</p><p>After a strong drink, I finally drifted off to sleep for a few hours at a hotel in town. I vividly recall the image that night. I am sitting in a car leaving the crushed rooftop of Westgate one final time. In my hands are the only survivors that day from the mall. They are two Black Moor fish in a plastic bag filled urgently with water. They swim in circles, glancing at each other, eyewitnesses that will never tell.</p>","image":"/content/images/2015/05/blackmoorfish.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_keywords":null,"abstract":"<span style=\"font-family: Lato, helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 16px;\">The crunch of shattered glass beneath my feet, the bullet holes in windows and the acrid smell of disaster enveloped me the moment I entered my favorite mall in Nairobi.

I had made a shift from entertainment only to hard news instantly when I saw the black smoke rise from the window on the nineteenth floor of Lohnro House in down town Nairobi on August 7, 1998.</p><p>The time was 10:38am. That was the moment the US embassy in Nairobi was attacked by terrorists. I was on the air. I remember how the building shook and how I thought it must be an earthquake. I remember watching a bearded American journalist for CNN reporting on the story a day later. His name was Jerrold Kessel. I never imagined I would one day be interviewing him on the air, as his anchor.</p><p>Months later at our home in Parklands, I was watching CNN one evening. I got it in my head “I can do that.” I tend to act quickly and relentlessly when I want something badly. Plus my dad always tells me to aim for the stars and even if I don’t make it, and land on the moon, then that’s OK too! So that’s what I did.</p><p>My friend Salim Amin of Camerapix in Nairobi referred me to a lady called Maggie Eales in London to whom I sent a demo tape of me reading the evening news at KTN. She passed in on to a woman who changed my life. Rena Golden, the head of talent and programming at CNN International based in London.</p><p>Once I received Rena’s email, I wouldn’t stop sending notes. The first time she emailed me, she told me that I looked good on camera but I had no real journalism experience and that I was more of an academic from what she could tell from my CV.</p><p>I responded saying that was not the case and I had done some very serious journalism for BBC radio. I offered to send her some scripts I had written under the guidance of senior producers in London. One of them was a thirty minute script on the deregistration of NGOs after the US embassy bombing in Kenya.</p><p>Rena agreed and I sent her every intelligent script I had written. She went silent for a long time and I mustered up the gall to send her another note. There were more that went by with no response.</p><p>At the same time I had been planning a trip to the United States to see a young man I was dating. In a breakthrough email to Rena, I said I was “coming to Atlanta anyway” and could she “please give me a screen test. “ My thinking was that I could use a piece of video with myself anchoring at CNN as part of another demo tape to send to another news organization. That was the best-case scenario for me professionally and personally I would have a wonderful time and spend a few days in Charleston and Savannah with my beau.</p><p>Rena replied saying something along these lines: “I am not hiring you, I will not give you a job, I will not pay for your ticket or your accommodation, but you can come if you want to and at your expense. I will give you a screen test.”</p><p>I couldn’t stop screaming with delight when I received that. I read every newspaper, every magazine I could, I watched the news on various channels, and then it came to the night before the trip. I had a crisis of confidence.</p><p>“Why am I even bothering,” I cried to my mum, “she’s told me she’s not hiring me.”</p><p>“Just go,” urged my mum. “Do it. You’ve come so far”</p><p>“But it’s a waste. Look how expensive this ticket is. It’s almost all my savings. Why am I even thinking I can do this? I don’t even know what I’m doing. I can’t do it.”</p><p>“Yes you can,” repeated mum over again. I doubted myself all night. I pulled myself together and then next day I caught the flight out from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi to Atlanta via Amsterdam.</p><p>At this point in my life I was feeling like a was a new person. I had suffered for many years from a skin disease called psoriasis, and survived an extreme form of its manifestation. My skin was exciting and clear for the first time in my young adult life and my mother had a beautiful strapless red dress made for me for when I met the man I was seeing for a lovely dinner. It was liberating to realize I could wear anything without stress or flakes of scales falling.</p><p>I will never forget walking though the red and blue exterior of the CNN building, the huge letters sitting outside and the park and parking deck around it. My palms sweated and my hands shook but my eyes sparkled with anticipation. I took at deep breath and asked for Rena Golden at the front desk.</p><p>Minutes later, she arrived, with a mane of black hair, a sharp suit no make up and a no nonsense attitude. She shook my hand briskly and whisked me up the escalator and left into the CNN International Newsroom.</p><p>I recall thinking how confident she was, I remember how she smiled at me reassuringly and how she communicated crisply and clearly. Rena walked me to the center of the newsroom and introduced me to Dan Williams, the head of writers, who was going to give me a general knowledge news quiz and also test my ability to “write news copy from news wires.” I had no idea what exactly that meant but I nodded and smiled nervously.</p><p>The quiz was basic and I handled it with ease. Then Dan gave me stories printed out from Reuters and the Associated Press and asked me to use that information to write the scripts that TV anchors read on air. I had never done this before but I managed to pull something off after about one hour.</p><p>Rena walked over and took me to a smaller studio. She told me she would ask me to read the prompter, conduct an interview and finally, handle a breaking news scenario. She said she would be “in my ear” meaning I would be able to hear her from an earpiece that I had just learned to wear.</p><p>Reading large white words rolling up a black screen was easy, though my mouth was dry. In the second go-around, the words suddenly disappeared as if someone had pressed delete. I looked down and picked up the sentence easily off the hard copy of paper scripts in front of me, and continued without missing a beat.</p><p>Next was a fake interview with the Israeli Prime Minster. Rena pretended to be him. She outlined the scenario and I asked a few basic questions to which she responded. I was no political expert, especially with the complexity of the Israeli – Palestinian conflict, so I kept my questions very basic, common sense, and didn’t try do any intellectual acrobatics.</p><p>Then it was time for breaking news. Jeff Marcowsky,a director in the CNN control room, had winked at me before I went into the studio and said “plane crash”. Brad Rhoads, a supervisor had also laughed about the same. I had my first inside tip.</p><p>Sure enough, Rena described the scene of a plane crash and asked me to do an interview with a reporter on the scene and to ad-lib about the crash. It was hard but I was having a fun once I settled into it and my adrenalin was racing.</p><p>At the end of the screen test she came in and asked “how long are you here for?”</p><p>“A couple more hours,” I said.</p><p>“Come and see me before you leave”</p><p>“Don’t forget a copy of the screen test on tape,” I reminded her.</p><p>In the time I was there I met with three additional players at CNN at the time, Riz Khan, an anchor of the famous Q&amp;A talk show. Riz was extremely warm and very funny. Steve Cassidy and Parisa Khosravi on the international desk, the heartbeat of a news operation that gathers the news, each met and talked to me. I asked many questions hoping that I would learn as much as possible in the little time I was going to be at CNN.</p><p>When it was it was time to leave, I went to see Rena to say goodbye and get my tape.</p><p>“Why don’t you come in for a chat” she said. I entered her corner office and sat down across from her in a comfortable black chair.</p><p>“What nationality are you,?” she asked.</p><p>“Kenyan,” I responded.</p><p>I will never ever forget the next lines she said to me. Till this day, it is one of the highlights of my life.</p><p>“I’m going to do something I’ve never done before. I’m going to offer you a job right now. I know where you have been the past few hours, I know who you have met with. I like how persistent you’ve been. That’s that kind of person I want at CNN.”</p><p>I stared at her, slowly beginning to understand what she was saying.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>She smiled. “You don’t have to respond right now. Take some time to think about it.”</p><p>“Yes!” I said. “I accept!” I wanted to jump up and down like crazy.</p><p>“I will hire you as a writer/producer” she said. “We will teach you the basic building blocks of television news. I’ll give you anchoring opportunities and if you do well I will promote you as a full time anchor. If not, you can continue to write and produce in the newsroom and then return to Kenya after that.”</p><p>It was incredible. I went to the hotel I was staying at, the Marriot Marquis in downtown Atlanta, and called home. My parents didn’t quite believe me at first. My father cried. We were all in total shock.</p><p>I returned to Kenya a week later, and played the song “Midnight Train to Georgia” by Gladys Knight every day on my mid-morning radio show on 94.4 Capital FM, and no one could figure out why I suddenly loved it so much.</p>","html":"<p>Rena</p><p>It was 1999 and I was hosting the mid morning show on Capital FM radio in Nairobi, anchoring the KTN news at night, and stringing for the BBC world service putting together more serious pieces.

Her family ran a laundry store in town and were relatively poor. She too had an arranged marriage to Remtuallah Verjee, my grandfather, a prominent man in Nairobi at the time.</p><p>She liked to dress both in Indian attire as well as English ladies dresses, with gloves and hats. She played rummy and bridge with friends on entertained a lot at home. Her life revolved around my grandfather and when he died in 1982, she lots her sense of purpose and joie de vivre, and suffered from depression and eventually a stroke.</p><p>I often think of Ma and Nanima and wonder what they would have thought of what I have done and become. I see Ma sitting near our grey old-fashioned telephone, on a dark brown chair, in a blue and white dressing gown, her hair in a bun, talking to her two close friends and laughing hard until her body shakes.</p><p>I see Nanima, cooking and softly singing to herself in her small cluttered apartment, watching the weather channel clock and making sure she was always on time.</p><p>My grandmothers combined taught me how to be tough, self reliant, to embrace Indian culture and at the same and to be gentle and compassionate in spirit.</p>","html":"<p>I believe in passion.

She gave me spending money, money for steroid medication for my skin disease, psoriasis when I didn’t have any, and didn’t get too angry with me when she found a packet of cigarettes hidden in my bag.</p><p>“This is not right,” she said, “it’s bad for your health”</p><p>“Please don’t tell mum,” was my desperate response.</p><p>“I won’t but stop it.”</p><p>She remained economically independent and strong willed until she passed away in 2009 in Toronto.</p><p>No matter how tough things got, she would say to all of us “Don’t worry, be happy,” somehow loving and internalizing the 1988 cappella hit song by Bobby McFerrin. This is how I remember her.</p><p>My dad’s mum, Daulat Khanu loved Boy George’s Karma Chameleon. I recall her dancing in a pink Indian Sari and singing with me at our old house in Gigiri, Nairobi.</p><p>“I’m amazed my one thing about you,” she said to me in Guajarati, the Indian dialect we spoke to both our grandmothers in.</p><p>“What?” I laughed dancing around, please that I just got the new ‘Now that’s what I called music’, cassette tape from London.</p><p>“That you can remember all the words to so many songs.” It’s true. I do have an uncanny memory for lyrics of songs I hear.</p><p>I was the closest of all grand children to Ma. I felt connected to her. She was a gentle spirit and cared for even the animals that lived around us.</p><p>She would feed sugar to the ants at home.</p><p>“What are you doing?” my father recalled asking her, startled at all the white lines in the garden.</p><p>“Even the ants have to eat,” she said, “who’s going to feed them.</p><p>She ordered prime meats for both Tommy the stray dog and mince for all the stray cats who I remember would turn up sharp at half past twelve for lunch daily.</p><p>Ma brought grocery items from old Kenyan women who would come to our gate with baskets of fresh vegetables and fruits.</p><p>She was born in a small town called Machakos in Kenya in 1920, the eldest of four children. Her family ran a laundry store in town and were relatively poor. She too had an arranged marriage to Remtuallah Verjee, my grandfather, a prominent man in Nairobi at the time.</p><p>She liked to dress both in Indian attire as well as English ladies dresses, with gloves and hats. She played rummy and bridge with friends on entertained a lot at home. Her life revolved around my grandfather and when he died in 1982, she lots her sense of purpose and joie de vivre, and suffered from depression and eventually a stroke.</p><p>I often think of Ma and Nanima and wonder what they would have thought of what I have done and become. I see Ma sitting near our grey old-fashioned telephone, on a dark brown chair, in a blue and white dressing gown, her hair in a bun, talking to her two close friends and laughing hard until her body shakes.</p><p>I see Nanima, cooking and softly singing to herself in her small cluttered apartment, watching the weather channel clock and making sure she was always on time.</p><p>My grandmothers combined taught me how to be tough, self reliant, to embrace Indian culture and at the same and to be gentle and compassionate in spirit.</p>","image":"/content/images/2015/05/BONIFACE_MWANGI82.JPG","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_keywords":null,"abstract":"<span style=\"color: rgb(77, 77, 77); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 18px; background-color: rgb(237, 239, 240);\">My grandmothers combined taught me how to be tough, self reliant, to embrace Indian culture and at the same and to be gentle and compassionate in spirit.</span>","author_id":3,"created_at":"2015-05-09T19:15:09.000Z","created_by":2,"updated_at":"2015-06-05T03:41:15.000Z","updated_by":2,"published_at":"2015-05-09T19:15:23.000Z","published_by":2},{"id":12,"uuid":"84ce84a0-3c31-4e8f-9b66-0f43d92c92b9","title":"Corvus","slug":"corvus","markdown":"<p>Victory was lonely for detective Lucy Onyango. &nbsp;The case breakthrough brought with it blinding flashlights, press conferences searching for a slick sound bite and a high profile award ceremony. &nbsp;Her star status demanded she be there, the smart glamorous and powerful symbol for Kenyan justice. &nbsp;But she was a no show for the dog and pony show. Every cellular device beeped and pinged her, until she removed the batteries to silence them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had earned this down time and no one was going to drag her out of the ritualized way she needed to spend it. &nbsp;Not the Police Commissioner himself, not the media hounds, not her own sense of duty. &nbsp;The vicious case was over and Lucy needed to self-inflict ‘pause’ and ‘mute’ while Nairobi churned ahead in a fast forward frenzy.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alone in her darkened room, the drapes drawn, and windows pulled in, she tried to forget. &nbsp;She remained numb for hours under the covers until it wore off and her demon, Feeling, returned. No matter how hard she attempted to block its surge, it rose like bile, her chest would ache, she would double over and the tears would gather to the edge of her lids but never cascade down her face. &nbsp;The walls would witness only her silent screaming. &nbsp;The self-imposed solitary confinement would last days, sometimes weeks.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The moment she solved a case was naturally exhilarating and satisfying. But it was short-lived because her past always sabotaged her present. She would see history and bad choices thundering like a freight train in the night, carrying a cargo of blame, to hit her as she lay on railway tracks waiting for the headlines lights to inevitably come closer. Guilt and regret mingled in those moments, hate and pain that had been filed away years after it happened resurfaced, and Lucy couldn’t bear her self. “Mercy”, she whispered repeatedly.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This case was particularly tough because young boys and girls had been the targets because they were white, too white. East African albinos in this region were coveted. Old wives tales that albino body parts held rare supernatural power were still believed, so dozens of children were kidnapped, trafficked between Kenya and Tanzania and killed. &nbsp;Her informants had come through, the sting operation had been successful and Lucy had nailed the perpetrators. &nbsp;They would face justice.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lucy lifted her tall sinewy body from her bed and stumbled out of the room, over her clothes, her gun, notebooks strewn on the floor, into the living room. She caught sight of herself in the mirror, exhausted red-rimmed eyes, her short hair stuck out in all directions exposing the small gold hoop earrings she had forgotten to remove. &nbsp;She had thick lips and large almond shaped eyes, the color of which was onyx black and fierce, and could bore a hole into anyone during an interrogation. &nbsp;Lucy stood in her white bra and underwear only. &nbsp;Her tattoo on her back, between her shoulder blades, was visible, two diamond shapes, on their sides and clasped together, representing handcuffs for offenders of the law. &nbsp;It was an old African folk symbol of law and justice.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was about to break it. &nbsp;Lucy opened the sliding door of her flat in the South B area of Nairobi, and stepped onto the balcony, bending over to rummage inside a plant. She pulled out a clear plastic bag from the dirt. &nbsp;What she did alone in her own space was her business, she just had to be careful or she would lose her position as the ranking female detective in the country, DCIO of Ongata Rongai police station.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She would only turn to marijuana when she sank so deep into herself that she needed to block it all out. The flash of the body, in the ditch, another cut to pieces, the bleeding, the eyes, their lifelessness and their hopelessness in the last moments on earth. &nbsp;Their loved ones would try to understand this level of brutality for the rest of their lives, wrestle with the courts, confront corruption, and incompetence. &nbsp;It would destroy some, and breathe passion into others, championing causes, seeking change, perhaps even starting a foundation, yet none of that would ever fill the hole. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Mercy,” she whispered as she lit up a tightly packed joint, closing her eyes, and throwing her head back in relief and allowing herself the cushion comfort of the smoke enveloping her. It was a relief. Thank goodness Alan, her boyfriend, was up country in Kiambu dealing with a sick aunt, and out of her way. He was a good man, he loved her, was loyal and rare. She didn’t know another Kenyan man who would be willing to do mundane household chores, and conduct a business on the sidelines.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lately though, she had to push away a gnawing irritation with him. &nbsp;It seemed unfair because he was loving and thoughtful. &nbsp;He wanted their relationship formalized with his Kikuyu family and her Luo one, two opposing tribes. &nbsp;Modern Kenya was fine with that, a Kariuki-Onyango marriage, but is that what she wanted? It seemed like the right, and natural step to take after two years. &nbsp;Alan wanted a child soon, but she was resistant. She wasn’t sure she wanted to bring a child into the violent and hateful world she was immersed in. &nbsp;Plus her new position was demanding, even with her unusual ability to recall sounds, images and small objects clearly. &nbsp;An eidetic memory was what the doctor at Nairobi hospital had called it. Right now she was so foggy, she couldn’t remember.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Lucy!” she heard someone shout, accompanied by a loud bang on the door. &nbsp;She jumped at the thud. &nbsp;She ignored in and inhaled the joint again slowly, holding it delicately between her right thumb and forefinger.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Open up! It’s Peter.” &nbsp;She shook her head. &nbsp;Peter Karanja was her number two, waiting to stab her in the back any time he could. He coveted the promotion she received, and was bitter when, after twenty years of service, he didn’t get it. He was an old school, old hand, sexist pig that was unable to come to terms with taking orders from a younger female officer. This was his perfect opportunity to report on her and she was too stoned to cover up her current state. She had been explicit that morning, and Peter knew she would be out of the mix for a while, like the cases before. &nbsp;He should relish being in charge for once, not be banging down her door. &nbsp;“Detective!” he kept calling out relentlessly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She didn’t answer and he eventually gave up. She knew he would be back. Something serious must have happened. Lucy reached into her pocket and turned on her mobile phone. Instantly, the double beeps flooded in making her flinch. Her tongue felt thick, like cotton wool, her mouth was dry and her eyes pleasantly glazed. &nbsp;She closed them, and took herself back for a split second to the lake where she had felt the freest and happiest in her life, playing with her sister and eating tilapia fish. &nbsp;Lucy looked at her messages and broke out in a sweat.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unsteady on her feet, she grasped the battered family furniture, the sparse white walls, banged her knee on the stained coffee table and turned on a cold shower. Lucy closed her eyes, threw her head back letting the needle like droplets pierce her chiseled face. &nbsp;Her body finally gave in, her shoulders heaved, she gasped and her body convulsed. &nbsp;The tears flowed for more than an hour. The release was the same each time and left her on her knees, forehead prostrated on the floor, watching the water circle lazily in slow rippled motions, taking their time before aimlessly sinking down the drain.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; She needed to focus quickly. Naked, Lucy grabbed a thick slab of bread in the kitchen, added butter and strawberry jam, and made a hot cup of milky tea. &nbsp;She ate and drank it in her room, while dressing. &nbsp; Lucy was stylish, though conservative in her dress. &nbsp;She wore the same outfit each day, no-nonsense, but still sexy and feminine: A narrow blue skirt that showed off her killer legs, crisp white shirt that exposed enough skin to display a sentimental silver necklace, and low heeled black shoes. &nbsp;She was five foot seven, and didn’t need to tower over her already intimidated male counterparts. &nbsp;She grabbed her gun, made sure it was loaded and packed it in behind her skirt, pulling on her well-fitting blue blazer.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Boss!” She could hear the sarcasm in his voice, as Peter turned up again rapping at her door. &nbsp;She flung it open, already annoyed.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I know, I saw the messages,” she snapped, noticing he was observing her carefully. &nbsp;She picked up her black purse, and thrust a few new note pads in. &nbsp;“I’m on my way.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Forensics is headed there now,” said Peter</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Good.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“We have a name.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Who?”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Daniel Drake.” Lucy stopped at the doorway and stared at him, various images and sounds of the man she had seen on TV funneling down through her mind at lightning speed.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“What? “ Drake was one of the most powerful businessmen in Kenya and Chairman and CEO of Raven International. “Are you sure?”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“The boss wants you on the case personally given the victim,” he said with thick traces of bitterness in his voice, referring to the Police Commissioner.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I’ll meet you there,” she said curtly walking out. “Askari,” she called out in Swahili to the guard who opened the white grilled gates to her detached home. Lucy reversed out in her white Toyota station wagon looking at the cream walls and brown rims of her middle class estate. She sped towards the Langata suburb, jockeying with the famous number 11 mini buses, called matatus, the main public transport in the area.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She passed the Mariakani Cottage hospital, glanced in the rearview mirror noticing Peter keeping up with her, as they made their way to the crime scene at Nairobi’s famous Ng’ong racecourse. Traffic on a Sunday would be horrendous, even with her siren blaring on the rooftop.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She reached Dagoretti corner and weaved through cars loaded with families looking to spend the afternoon at the Junction Mall no doubt at the KFC that has recently opened up there. She leaned out of her window and ordered a group of ‘chokoras’, street boys who looked up to no good and likely high on glue, out of the way. Lucy took in the hyper detail of her environment. She swerved around and cursed at a matatu that refused to give way to her. Matatu names were memorable and she noted this one when she had more time to reprimand the driver. It was called ‘XYZ’, after a popular Kenyan satirical cartoon show.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The ‘Jua Kali’ industry was in full swing. It literally translated to the ‘hot sun’ and meant that these goods and services on the streets operated outside the formal business sector of the city. &nbsp;The trade was roaring as always, flowerpots and funeral stones, sand and soapstone furniture and fashionable second hand clothes, lined up on the dirty sidewalks. Lingala music from Congo blasted from old-fashioned radios and men and women sat under trees drinking Vimto or Fanta sodas swapping gossip or complaining about the endless spates of political dramas, as they waited for potential customers.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Water tankers were parked haphazardly next to each other with ‘soft water’ painted carefully on both sides. &nbsp;There was a water shortage in the city recently, and many were desperate just to bathe. She saw large drums of water being loaded onto the back of a pick up truck likely to pour into a water tank. &nbsp;Dozens of people carried small yellow jerry cans of water too. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Yes,” said Lucy picking up her phone?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“It’s forensics. We are here and ready to enter.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Go in.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Yes detective.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I’ll be there in a few minutes and will need access. I want a set of plastic gloves and shoes ready.”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“We’ve set up a tent outside already and the police have the cordon.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lucy took a deep breath as she turned onto the slip road leading to the racecourse. ”No one leaves without my permission,” she said to the guard at the gate, noticing the throngs of people standing under the trees.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This was going to be her most high profile case, as the worst possible time for her. &nbsp;She had to be on her A-game. So did the men plotting just a few miles away.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Chapter 2: The Hunters</b></p><p>&nbsp;Somewhere in Nairobi the small room glowed with the blue neon light from monitors and the claustrophobic reflections it threw in the small shadowy room. The five men inside preferred it this way; always nighttime so there was less chance of discovery. They were fierce in their focus technically savvy, arrogant about their capabilities and exceptionally greedy. This one mission was going to deliver more money than they would see in a lifetime of slogging but the danger, and the stakes were high.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was no margin for error inside this pod where technology was the most lethal and the most spectacular. Each had accepted there would be no contact with any one in the outside world for fear of slipping up, sending a signal that could lead to discovery and disaster.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Each had proven their mental strength and almost warped ability to block out the world of lattes, bills, cafes and movies, to stifle emotion and desire, and refusal to trust, except perhaps, each other. They were in it together, embracing a life of falsehoods that hid behind the shattered tapestry of their own lives.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They tolerated the tight dirty brown cubicles, the cold coffees, overflowing ashtrays, crushed soda cans and stale pizza, the daily dinner, always frozen and stocked up for the week. Tense faces and urgent voices rose suddenly breaking the bleary-eyed methodical typing and mapping.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“To the left more”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I can’t keep up, she’s moving faster.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Just step on it will you.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“She’s changing course, good, slowing down. Here we go.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“There!”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Put a lock on it.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All eyes were glued to the largest monitor in the room. They had their prey in sight and she was beautiful, waiting to be taken.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“The boss will be pleased.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“It’s taken long enough.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“The bird had a problem. It took time to fix.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Don’t let it happen again.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Right.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“She’s pretty spectacular.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Get back to work boys. This is just the beginning of hard days ahead. This is what we’ve been working towards.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From now on, whatever maneuvers the target made, however unexpected or clever, Master Control was watching for that inevitable moment of weakness, waiting for a mistake and it would happen soon.

She saw large drums of water being loaded onto the back of a pick up truck likely to pour into a water tank. &nbsp;Dozens of people carried small yellow jerry cans of water too. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Yes,” said Lucy picking up her phone?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“It’s forensics. We are here and ready to enter.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Go in.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Yes detective.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I’ll be there in a few minutes and will need access. I want a set of plastic gloves and shoes ready.”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“We’ve set up a tent outside already and the police have the cordon.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lucy took a deep breath as she turned onto the slip road leading to the racecourse. ”No one leaves without my permission,” she said to the guard at the gate, noticing the throngs of people standing under the trees.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This was going to be her most high profile case, as the worst possible time for her. &nbsp;She had to be on her A-game. So did the men plotting just a few miles away.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Chapter 2: The Hunters</b></p><p>&nbsp;Somewhere in Nairobi the small room glowed with the blue neon light from monitors and the claustrophobic reflections it threw in the small shadowy room. The five men inside preferred it this way; always nighttime so there was less chance of discovery. They were fierce in their focus technically savvy, arrogant about their capabilities and exceptionally greedy. This one mission was going to deliver more money than they would see in a lifetime of slogging but the danger, and the stakes were high.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was no margin for error inside this pod where technology was the most lethal and the most spectacular. Each had accepted there would be no contact with any one in the outside world for fear of slipping up, sending a signal that could lead to discovery and disaster.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Each had proven their mental strength and almost warped ability to block out the world of lattes, bills, cafes and movies, to stifle emotion and desire, and refusal to trust, except perhaps, each other. They were in it together, embracing a life of falsehoods that hid behind the shattered tapestry of their own lives.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They tolerated the tight dirty brown cubicles, the cold coffees, overflowing ashtrays, crushed soda cans and stale pizza, the daily dinner, always frozen and stocked up for the week. Tense faces and urgent voices rose suddenly breaking the bleary-eyed methodical typing and mapping.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“To the left more”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I can’t keep up, she’s moving faster.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Just step on it will you.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“She’s changing course, good, slowing down. Here we go.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“There!”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Put a lock on it.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All eyes were glued to the largest monitor in the room. They had their prey in sight and she was beautiful, waiting to be taken.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“The boss will be pleased.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“It’s taken long enough.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“The bird had a problem. It took time to fix.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Don’t let it happen again.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Right.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“She’s pretty spectacular.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Get back to work boys. This is just the beginning of hard days ahead. This is what we’ve been working towards.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From now on, whatever maneuvers the target made, however unexpected or clever, Master Control was watching for that inevitable moment of weakness, waiting for a mistake and it would happen soon. All that was needed was the agreed upon order from the man calling the shots.

Yet I have spent a lifetime hiding.</p><p>For years, I guard a painful secret: I can't bear to look in the mirror. I shrink from bright light. A gaze that lingers a second too long makes me panic. A hot summer day sends me into the shadows.</p><p>I have fish-like scales. There are tiny red islands floating on the surface of my skin. They combine to create continents with jagged surfaces. They turn black and start to smell. There is blood and pus.</p><p>My scalp spits out silver flakes. My ears are filled with crusts. I leave white specks wherever I sit. I float in long, loose clothes. My hands betray me. The sores sit openly. My nails are dented with pockmarks. I find strands of hair on the sheets and pillowcases every morning.</p><p>I suffer from psoriasis. It's ravaged my body since I was 8. At its worst my plaques look like leprosy. I feel like a leper.</p><p>\"Please can you leave the pool,\" a woman once told me when I was 22, visiting the Dead Sea in Israel, \"we're not comfortable with you in it.\" She is horrified at my body.

When I want to give up, she will not let me.</p><p>She becomes an expert on psoriasis. She reads medical journals and approaches alternative healers. She takes me for acupuncture and hypnosis. She mixes various acids in a lab for me to use on my skin and soaks me in a tub full of Dead Sea salt. The rest of the day, I am in a messy, smelly cream. Endless personal research, trial and error bring occasional relief.</p><p>Imagine the nightmarish teen years. I cower from close friendships. No one can know the truth. I never date. Intimacy is out of the question. I have no sensation of touch. The scales are too thick.</p><p>The itch is unbearable. I try and ignore it. It's impossible. It agitates me. I use all my strength and I tear at my skin. I am violent. I scratch back and forth until there is blood. It is too raw to do any more. I am filled with rage and humiliated.</p><p>So I disappear in my head, create fictional stories and characters.

I wasn’t talking about you! I’m sure your mom is very pleasant!” I call after them but they’ve already scampered down the hall, probably to the safety of the freshman hall.</p><p>Someone in the office must be playing around with me, because they paired me up with the smartest and most science obsessed kid in the entire school. I was just looking for a nerd that I could charm with a smile and a low-cut top here in there to give me all the answers to my next Chem test.</p><p>JP Carlson was definitely NOT going to be that person for me. Although I had never really talked to JP, he has a reputation of being a pompous know-it-all that was also positively incorruptible . Apparently, one conversation with him will leave you feeling like a stupid monkey that hasn’t been blessed by evolution—his words, not mine. This kid would take one look at my Chemistry grade and laugh me all the way to summer school—or worse a 5th year of high school. I quickly turned back to the office and marched to the front desk.</p><p>“Excuse me,” I said to the girl sitting at the desk, “I think there has been some kind of mistake.” I handed her my paper and she glanced it over. “There is no mistake,” she said and returned my paper, “JP is the tutor that covers all junior science cases.” Cases? What the hell? I’m not a junkie or something! I’m just a dummy that can’t grasp the fundamentals of Chemistry! “Um…ok then. Sorry.” I replied, took my paper, and left the office. Guess I really am going to have to be humiliated in front of the smartest kid in all South Carolina.</p><p>I warily made my way to the library secretly hoping JP was too busy working on the next nuclear reactor or some shit to bother tutoring me.</p><p>No such luck.</p><p>He was sitting at one of the round tables near the windows with piles of chemistry books surrounding him, looking at the books like they were Lego’s and he was a three-year old kid that couldn’t wait to play with them.</p><p>“What…a…WEIRDO” I muttered and plastered a fake smile on my face as I walked up to him.</p><p>“Hi JP, I’m Charlie.”</p><p>He looked up at me and flashed the most beautiful smile I have ever seen on any human being that isn’t Ryan Gosling. I looked at him closely then realized that Mr. Supernerd is actually a Superhottie!</p><p>“Hi Charlie,” he said, the beautiful smile still on his face, “you’re ten minutes late.” Needles to say that winning smile disappeared in a heart beat and it was kind of sad to see if go.</p><p>He motioned to the seat next to him and I plopped down rolling my eyes. I was tempted tell him I didn’t want him to tutor me and was desperately trying to get rid of him, but decided against it. It’s bad enough that the nerd/hottie has to help me with chemistry and that he thinks I don’t have the mental capacity to tell time. No point adding, ‘rude bitch’ to the laundry list of my apparent flaws.</p><p>“So why are you here Charlie?” he asked after I finally pulled all my stuff from my bag.</p><p>Is this kid serious? I clearly need help in Chemistry.</p><p>“Well…um…I suck at Chemistry and would really prefer to graduate with the rest of the kids my age. So I need help,” I said trying to hide the irritation in my voice.</p><p>“Well that’s excellent!” He exclaimed adjusting his glasses (which totally hid these gorgeous grey eyes), “You are motivated and willing to take the initiative to improve your grade and your study skills.” I stared at him in disbelief.</p><p>Seriously kid, who are you? Motivation? Initiative? You sound like one of those inspirational posters they hang in the counseling office.</p><p>“Yea sure whatever,” I said tapping my pencil anxiously, “Can we get started? I have to meet up with my friends in an hour.”</p><p>“Friends can wait, Charlie. However, your performance in your chemistry class cannot afford to be ignored any longer. This tutoring session cannot wait.” JP said quietly.</p><p>Ok, I don’t care how hot this kid might be, he is really getting on my nerves. So I decided to get back at him at bit.</p><p>“JP, lemme ask you something.”</p><p>“Yes?” he asked, probably assuming I was going to ask him about photosynthesis or some sciencey shit like that.</p><p>“What do you do for fun? Like real fun, besides building models of atoms or stuff like that?” I asked.</p><p>“That question is irrelevant to this study session. If you want to ask me something about chemistry then I have an answer for you.” He retorted.</p><p>“It was just a simple question” I muttered flipping through my chemistry book—it looked like gibberish to me.</p><p>“Ok,” he said, “Well I have a simple question for you.”</p><p>“Go ahead. I’m an open book. Pun intended” I replied glibly, motioning to the open book in front of me.</p><p>I could tell he wanted to laugh at my cheesy joke but decided to say “professional”</p><p>“Why are you really here? I looked at you transcript and chemistry is not the only class you are struggling in. You’ve pulled up your other grades from earlier this semester, but something doesn’t make sense. You were a fairly good student before Christmas break and all of a sudden your grades plummet. What happened over Christmas break?” he asked.</p><p>Oh I don’t know…lets think. Well first I lied to my best friends, nearly got them arrested and all of that just to lose the love of my life to my childhood arch nemesis. Nope…nothing of significance that would cause my grades to fall. But there is no way in hell I’m telling Mr. Smarty Pants all that though.</p><p>“Look, it’s really cute that you care and everything,” I said slamming my book closed and standing up, “But I did not sign up for a counseling session. So if you want to go all Oprah circa 2004 on me, I can leave.”</p><p>“Charlie sit down,” JP said, standing up as well. “I didn’t mean to upset you. You obviously don’t want to talk about it so let’s just keep this professional and leave the personal questions outside of the tutoring sessions? OK?”</p><p>Outside of tutoring sessions? Does he think we’re going to become besties and talk about our life problems? I think not.</p><p>“Fine…”I muttered. “But the only reason I’m staying is because being on the five-year plan is really not a good look for anyone.”</p>","html":"<p>I glance down at the paper in my hand and stare in shock.</p><p>“Sonofabitch!” I yell, scaring a tiny freshman that happened to be walking right by me.</p><p>“Sorry! I wasn’t talking about you! I’m sure your mom is very pleasant!” I call after them but they’ve already scampered down the hall, probably to the safety of the freshman hall.</p><p>Someone in the office must be playing around with me, because they paired me up with the smartest and most science obsessed kid in the entire school. I was just looking for a nerd that I could charm with a smile and a low-cut top here in there to give me all the answers to my next Chem test.</p><p>JP Carlson was definitely NOT going to be that person for me. Although I had never really talked to JP, he has a reputation of being a pompous know-it-all that was also positively incorruptible . Apparently, one conversation with him will leave you feeling like a stupid monkey that hasn’t been blessed by evolution—his words, not mine. This kid would take one look at my Chemistry grade and laugh me all the way to summer school—or worse a 5th year of high school. I quickly turned back to the office and marched to the front desk.</p><p>“Excuse me,” I said to the girl sitting at the desk, “I think there has been some kind of mistake.” I handed her my paper and she glanced it over. “There is no mistake,” she said and returned my paper, “JP is the tutor that covers all junior science cases.” Cases? What the hell? I’m not a junkie or something! I’m just a dummy that can’t grasp the fundamentals of Chemistry! “Um…ok then. Sorry.” I replied, took my paper, and left the office. Guess I really am going to have to be humiliated in front of the smartest kid in all South Carolina.</p><p>I warily made my way to the library secretly hoping JP was too busy working on the next nuclear reactor or some shit to bother tutoring me.</p><p>No such luck.</p><p>He was sitting at one of the round tables near the windows with piles of chemistry books surrounding him, looking at the books like they were Lego’s and he was a three-year old kid that couldn’t wait to play with them.</p><p>“What…a…WEIRDO” I muttered and plastered a fake smile on my face as I walked up to him.</p><p>“Hi JP, I’m Charlie.”</p><p>He looked up at me and flashed the most beautiful smile I have ever seen on any human being that isn’t Ryan Gosling. I looked at him closely then realized that Mr. Supernerd is actually a Superhottie!</p><p>“Hi Charlie,” he said, the beautiful smile still on his face, “you’re ten minutes late.” Needles to say that winning smile disappeared in a heart beat and it was kind of sad to see if go.</p><p>He motioned to the seat next to him and I plopped down rolling my eyes. I was tempted tell him I didn’t want him to tutor me and was desperately trying to get rid of him, but decided against it. It’s bad enough that the nerd/hottie has to help me with chemistry and that he thinks I don’t have the mental capacity to tell time. No point adding, ‘rude bitch’ to the laundry list of my apparent flaws.</p><p>“So why are you here Charlie?” he asked after I finally pulled all my stuff from my bag.</p><p>Is this kid serious? I clearly need help in Chemistry.</p><p>“Well…um…I suck at Chemistry and would really prefer to graduate with the rest of the kids my age. So I need help,” I said trying to hide the irritation in my voice.</p><p>“Well that’s excellent!” He exclaimed adjusting his glasses (which totally hid these gorgeous grey eyes), “You are motivated and willing to take the initiative to improve your grade and your study skills.” I stared at him in disbelief.</p><p>Seriously kid, who are you? Motivation? Initiative? You sound like one of those inspirational posters they hang in the counseling office.</p><p>“Yea sure whatever,” I said tapping my pencil anxiously, “Can we get started? I have to meet up with my friends in an hour.”</p><p>“Friends can wait, Charlie. However, your performance in your chemistry class cannot afford to be ignored any longer. This tutoring session cannot wait.” JP said quietly.</p><p>Ok, I don’t care how hot this kid might be, he is really getting on my nerves. So I decided to get back at him at bit.</p><p>“JP, lemme ask you something.”</p><p>“Yes?” he asked, probably assuming I was going to ask him about photosynthesis or some sciencey shit like that.</p><p>“What do you do for fun? Like real fun, besides building models of atoms or stuff like that?” I asked.</p><p>“That question is irrelevant to this study session. If you want to ask me something about chemistry then I have an answer for you.” He retorted.</p><p>“It was just a simple question” I muttered flipping through my chemistry book—it looked like gibberish to me.</p><p>“Ok,” he said, “Well I have a simple question for you.”</p><p>“Go ahead. I’m an open book. Pun intended” I replied glibly, motioning to the open book in front of me.</p><p>I could tell he wanted to laugh at my cheesy joke but decided to say “professional”</p><p>“Why are you really here? I looked at you transcript and chemistry is not the only class you are struggling in. You’ve pulled up your other grades from earlier this semester, but something doesn’t make sense. You were a fairly good student before Christmas break and all of a sudden your grades plummet. What happened over Christmas break?” he asked.</p><p>Oh I don’t know…lets think. Well first I lied to my best friends, nearly got them arrested and all of that just to lose the love of my life to my childhood arch nemesis. Nope…nothing of significance that would cause my grades to fall. But there is no way in hell I’m telling Mr. Smarty Pants all that though.</p><p>“Look, it’s really cute that you care and everything,” I said slamming my book closed and standing up, “But I did not sign up for a counseling session.
