I thought this was my final semester in b-school, whatâ€™s all this work coming at me about? Someone must have been smoking the green stuff when they claimed this would be an easy semester, because it is pretty evident that my professors are intent on making my behind work like an animal this semester.Iâ€™m still going to Brazil and Argentina, thatâ€™s for real (ended up having a ball in South America). I donâ€™t care if I have a midterm the day after spring break.</p><p>So it seems a lot has happened while we all took off and did the do during the holidays (wrote this right after the elections). Now, we have an MBA as the president of the country. Iâ€™m not necessarily jumping up for joy, I mean, this puts the MBA crowd in the spotlight and it doesnâ€™t make it any better that heâ€™s from Harvard. We all know their work ethic, so if Dubya blows the economy or screws up the countryâ€™s fiscal policy, then MBA recruiters are going to start re-evaluating their relationships with business schools. Now, if he was a Stern MBA, with a couple of courses with Messrs. Smith and Yermack, then I would feel a lot more confident (ok, so it gets a little competitive amongst b-schools, that\'s why MBAs are such a sorry bunch). Weâ€™ll watch and see, G.W. Donâ€™t go starting a war with Hawaii (yes it is one of the 50 states, Dubya) or Puerto Rico when stuff hits the fan, you better dig into your â€œConflicts and Negotiationsâ€ textbook and handle your business, boy (wow, it\'s almost like I knew this bobo would start something...damn!!).</p><p>So I had an interesting vacation. Iâ€™m sitting at home, watching TV when I got a phone call from my mother in Nigeria . We talked for a little bit, yâ€™know, I missed her, she missed me, my grandfather (Pimp Daddy Extraordinaire) was married (he\'s about 95 years old...I want to be like him when I grow up. Pimp Daddy!!)â€¦yâ€™know, the good stuff.</p><p>Then she got silent.â€œMama,â€ I inquired, â€œare you alright?â€ Now, in most African cultures, once your parents or elders take a long pause (the pauses have gradually increased as the wedding day gets nearer) when they are speaking to you, your ass is about to get toasted. Dunked on. Plastered. I heard her exhale on the other end. â€œChidi, my son,â€ she started. My heart did a triple axle-trifecta-double-pumped somersault. I popped two Levitra...sorry, two Tylenol extra strength in anticipation of the migraines headed my way via the phone line.</p><p>She continued, â€œI am proud of you. I am really proud of you. You are about to graduate with an MBA and you are the envy of many of your friends back home in Nigeria (actually, no envy whatsoever. The fact is, I didn\'t become a doctor. That signals failure. If you are a young Nigerian in the States and you are not a doctor or pharmacist, you have failed the Igbo Nation. You are required to denounce you Igbohood sixty days after failure). You have done well and God has blessed me with a first son like you.â€ She paused again.</p><p>Oh, boy.</p><p>Okay, now let me explain what she was doing here. This was a common technique used by our folks when serious topics where discussed. Let me use an anecdote to break it own for you. I attended boarding school in Nigeria. It was the best experience in my life; it was also the most harrowing six years any young man could live through on this planet (high school in Nigeria was just incredible. I have the scars to prove it). Oz? That is Disney World compared to boarding school in Nigeria. Anyways, when I was about fifteen, in Class 5 (which is equivalent to the junior year in high school), we had an occurrence of rat attacks. Yes, rat attacks. Fellas would wake up in the morning and discover parts of their toes missing. You would be sleeping in your corner and then get jolted awake by the piercing scream of some poor sonofabitch, whose pinkie toe was now half there, half gone. At first we thought that the spirits of Rumuokwuta were finally exacting justice upon the poor pinkie-less souls, but we had to investigate.</p><p>A nocturnal investigative team was formed to find out what was going on. I ran point on the team. What we saw shocked even myself, who had connections with the spirit world (we still talk, but we had a falling out. always scaring me half to death). At approximately ten to fifteen minutes after two in the morning, as we regaled each other with tales from the crypt, these humongous rats would come out of the woodworks, sneak into the dorm room and position themselves right at the juiciest feet on the lower bunk beds. Then they would nibble a bit on the toe, then blow softly on the toe to intercept and obliterate any pain signals going to the poor guyâ€™s brain. Nibble, blow, nibble, blow (i swear!!). The poor guy wouldnâ€™t feel a thing.</p><p>You see, I was getting the â€œnibble, blowâ€ treatment from The Mama.</p><p>â€œSo, my son. I need to ask you a question.â€ I popped two more Tylenols.</p><p>â€œWhen are you going to get married?â€</p><p>Whoa. (yeah...like whoa!)</p><p>The Mama started tearing into me. â€œAll your friends here in Nigeria have gotten married (every single one of them). I went to Okeyâ€™s wedding last week. In fact, Kelechi is about to have her second baby.â€</p><p>I was speechless. Kelechi? Her second baby? Damn. She was fine, too. Now thatâ€™s someone I could have married (thank God I didn\'t. I heard she went psycho on her husband, and got a job).</p><p>â€œWellâ€¦uhâ€¦Mamaâ€¦yâ€™seeâ€¦â€ I was stuttering like a Stern MBA at a Bain interview.</p><p>â€œDonâ€™t you â€˜wellâ€¦uhâ€™ me. Look, you are old enough to father as many children as the head cockerel on our compound (true, true). Tell me, Chidi, what are you waiting for, eh?â€ (uh, graduation? A job? Some money? How about a woman?) The Mama was getting heated and I was not helping by cowering on the other end of the line. I had to mount a strong defense.</p><p>â€œBut, Mama,â€ I countered, â€œI am going to school. I have no money, I donâ€™t even have a job, what woman would want a broke man like me. I canâ€™t even buy water.â€ Now, that was a good counter-attack.</p><p>â€œShaaarrraaappp, you idiotâ€, The Mama bellowed into the phone. â€œWhat do you mean you are broke, eh? Didnâ€™t you tell me some of your classmates are being offered salaries of two hundred thousand dollars a year? (ok...so maybe I exagerrated a little bit there). I have told everyone you will be making at least three hundred thousand since you are smarter than all of them, right? (now this is bordering on delusional). Didnâ€™t you tell me you already had an offer? â€</p><p>Typical Naija. Four rapid fire sentences, and they all ended with question marks.</p><p>Damn. I fed her all that stuff so she could feel like this MBA thing was a good idea. Now she was using it against me. And there was no way I was going to start explaining that the economy was â€œrecedingâ€ some of those freaking gazillion, pravillion dollar offers. My mother is brilliant. I never could beat her in an argument, and I usually donâ€™t lose my arguments (well, since The Ngozi showed up, I have been losing consistently every day).</p><p>She shoved aside the money issue. â€œI know you will make money, that is not a concern for me. I think it is time for you to get married and have children. Some of my friends have seen your pictures from America and they have come to visit me with their daughters.â€ She stopped to hear my reaction. I inhaled deeply. I knew this was bound to happen soon, so I pretty much acquiesced and asked her what she wanted me to do. I heard the rustling of paper on her end. The Mama always had her stuff together.</p><p>â€œWell, I have five girls that I really like. Their families are very well respected and these girls were raised very properly.â€ I could hear her smiling (i admit, I was smiling too).</p><p>â€œThese girls are beautiful too. Do you remember Nkiru?â€ Yes, I remembered Nkiru. She dumped me like used toilet paper when I was sixteen. Now she wanted to marry me. Iâ€™m sure the picture of me beside my ex-bossâ€™s Escalade XLT had nothing do with her sudden affection for me.</p><p>As I listened to her, I couldnâ€™t help but note how absurd it all sounded. Who told her I wanted someone who was raised properly? Why couldnâ€™t I get one of those booty-shaking girls in all those hip-hop videos (you know, I did end up with a booty shaking girl...heh-heh. Sorry, the Ngozi)?</p><p>The Mama then finished with one of her patented concluding statements. â€œWhy donâ€™t you come home in May and visit me? And you can also meet these girls, you might like one of them. I also have some presents that I have bought for youâ€¦actually, my friends bought them for you. Chidi, you know I love you, right?â€œ</p><p>Nibble, blow, nibble, blow.</p>','<p>Well, it\'s time to get this party started once again this semesterâ€¦Iâ€™m sitting in disbelief at the amount of stuff I have due next week.

I donâ€™t care if I have a midterm the day after spring break.</p><p>So it seems a lot has happened while we all took off and did the do during the holidays (wrote this right after the elections). Now, we have an MBA as the president of the country. Iâ€™m not necessarily jumping up for joy, I mean, this puts the MBA crowd in the spotlight and it doesnâ€™t make it any better that heâ€™s from Harvard. We all know their work ethic, so if Dubya blows the economy or screws up the countryâ€™s fiscal policy, then MBA recruiters are going to start re-evaluating their relationships with business schools. Now, if he was a Stern MBA, with a couple of courses with Messrs. Smith and Yermack, then I would feel a lot more confident (ok, so it gets a little competitive amongst b-schools, that\'s why MBAs are such a sorry bunch). Weâ€™ll watch and see, G.W. Donâ€™t go starting a war with Hawaii (yes it is one of the 50 states, Dubya) or Puerto Rico when stuff hits the fan, you better dig into your â€œConflicts and Negotiationsâ€ textbook and handle your business, boy (wow, it\'s almost like I knew this bobo would start something...damn!!).</p><p>So I had an interesting vacation. Iâ€™m sitting at home, watching TV when I got a phone call from my mother in Nigeria . We talked for a little bit, yâ€™know, I missed her, she missed me, my grandfather (Pimp Daddy Extraordinaire) was married (he\'s about 95 years old...I want to be like him when I grow up. Pimp Daddy!!)â€¦yâ€™know, the good stuff.</p><p>Then she got silent.â€œMama,â€ I inquired, â€œare you alright?â€ Now, in most African cultures, once your parents or elders take a long pause (the pauses have gradually increased as the wedding day gets nearer) when they are speaking to you, your ass is about to get toasted. Dunked on. Plastered. I heard her exhale on the other end. â€œChidi, my son,â€ she started. My heart did a triple axle-trifecta-double-pumped somersault. I popped two Levitra...sorry, two Tylenol extra strength in anticipation of the migraines headed my way via the phone line.</p><p>She continued, â€œI am proud of you. I am really proud of you. You are about to graduate with an MBA and you are the envy of many of your friends back home in Nigeria (actually, no envy whatsoever. The fact is, I didn\'t become a doctor. That signals failure. If you are a young Nigerian in the States and you are not a doctor or pharmacist, you have failed the Igbo Nation. You are required to denounce you Igbohood sixty days after failure). You have done well and God has blessed me with a first son like you.â€ She paused again.</p><p>Oh, boy.</p><p>Okay, now let me explain what she was doing here. This was a common technique used by our folks when serious topics where discussed. Let me use an anecdote to break it own for you. I attended boarding school in Nigeria. It was the best experience in my life; it was also the most harrowing six years any young man could live through on this planet (high school in Nigeria was just incredible. I have the scars to prove it). Oz? That is Disney World compared to boarding school in Nigeria. Anyways, when I was about fifteen, in Class 5 (which is equivalent to the junior year in high school), we had an occurrence of rat attacks. Yes, rat attacks. Fellas would wake up in the morning and discover parts of their toes missing. You would be sleeping in your corner and then get jolted awake by the piercing scream of some poor sonofabitch, whose pinkie toe was now half there, half gone. At first we thought that the spirits of Rumuokwuta were finally exacting justice upon the poor pinkie-less souls, but we had to investigate.</p><p>A nocturnal investigative team was formed to find out what was going on. I ran point on the team. What we saw shocked even myself, who had connections with the spirit world (we still talk, but we had a falling out. always scaring me half to death). At approximately ten to fifteen minutes after two in the morning, as we regaled each other with tales from the crypt, these humongous rats would come out of the woodworks, sneak into the dorm room and position themselves right at the juiciest feet on the lower bunk beds. Then they would nibble a bit on the toe, then blow softly on the toe to intercept and obliterate any pain signals going to the poor guyâ€™s brain. Nibble, blow, nibble, blow (i swear!!). The poor guy wouldnâ€™t feel a thing.</p><p>You see, I was getting the â€œnibble, blowâ€ treatment from The Mama.</p><p>â€œSo, my son. I need to ask you a question.â€ I popped two more Tylenols.</p><p>â€œWhen are you going to get married?â€</p><p>Whoa. (yeah...like whoa!)</p><p>The Mama started tearing into me. â€œAll your friends here in Nigeria have gotten married (every single one of them). I went to Okeyâ€™s wedding last week. In fact, Kelechi is about to have her second baby.â€</p><p>I was speechless. Kelechi? Her second baby? Damn. She was fine, too. Now thatâ€™s someone I could have married (thank God I didn\'t. I heard she went psycho on her husband, and got a job).</p><p>â€œWellâ€¦uhâ€¦Mamaâ€¦yâ€™seeâ€¦â€ I was stuttering like a Stern MBA at a Bain interview.</p><p>â€œDonâ€™t you â€˜wellâ€¦uhâ€™ me. Look, you are old enough to father as many children as the head cockerel on our compound (true, true). Tell me, Chidi, what are you waiting for, eh?â€ (uh, graduation? A job? Some money? How about a woman?) The Mama was getting heated and I was not helping by cowering on the other end of the line. I had to mount a strong defense.</p><p>â€œBut, Mama,â€ I countered, â€œI am going to school. I have no money, I donâ€™t even have a job, what woman would want a broke man like me. I canâ€™t even buy water.â€ Now, that was a good counter-attack.</p><p>â€œShaaarrraaappp, you idiotâ€, The Mama bellowed into the phone. â€œWhat do you mean you are broke, eh? Didnâ€™t you tell me some of your classmates are being offered salaries of two hundred thousand dollars a year? (ok...so maybe I exagerrated a little bit there). I have told everyone you will be making at least three hundred thousand since you are smarter than all of them, right? (now this is bordering on delusional). Didnâ€™t you tell me you already had an offer? â€</p><p>Typical Naija. Four rapid fire sentences, and they all ended with question marks.</p><p>Damn. I fed her all that stuff so she could feel like this MBA thing was a good idea. Now she was using it against me. And there was no way I was going to start explaining that the economy was â€œrecedingâ€ some of those freaking gazillion, pravillion dollar offers. My mother is brilliant. I never could beat her in an argument, and I usually donâ€™t lose my arguments (well, since The Ngozi showed up, I have been losing consistently every day).</p><p>She shoved aside the money issue. â€œI know you will make money, that is not a concern for me. I think it is time for you to get married and have children. Some of my friends have seen your pictures from America and they have come to visit me with their daughters.â€ She stopped to hear my reaction. I inhaled deeply. I knew this was bound to happen soon, so I pretty much acquiesced and asked her what she wanted me to do. I heard the rustling of paper on her end. The Mama always had her stuff together.</p><p>â€œWell, I have five girls that I really like. Their families are very well respected and these girls were raised very properly.â€ I could hear her smiling (i admit, I was smiling too).</p><p>â€œThese girls are beautiful too. Do you remember Nkiru?â€ Yes, I remembered Nkiru. She dumped me like used toilet paper when I was sixteen. Now she wanted to marry me. Iâ€™m sure the picture of me beside my ex-bossâ€™s Escalade XLT had nothing do with her sudden affection for me.</p><p>As I listened to her, I couldnâ€™t help but note how absurd it all sounded. Who told her I wanted someone who was raised properly? Why couldnâ€™t I get one of those booty-shaking girls in all those hip-hop videos (you know, I did end up with a booty shaking girl...heh-heh. Sorry, the Ngozi)?</p><p>The Mama then finished with one of her patented concluding statements. â€œWhy donâ€™t you come home in May and visit me? And you can also meet these girls, you might like one of them. I also have some presents that I have bought for youâ€¦actually, my friends bought them for you. Chidi, you know I love you, right?â€œ</p><p>Nibble, blow, nibble, blow.</p>','/content/images/2015/05/BONIFACE_MWANGI017.jpg',0,0,'published','en_US',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Here\'s a little something I wrote for my column in b-school during the spring of 2001.

Its a single seat which means I don\'t have to deal with anyone more than myself. When you want to alight, you don\'t bother anyone and no one else bothers you when they are alighting. Perfect.

So thatâ€™s what I did.</p><p>My friend Salim Amin of Camerapix in Nairobi referred me to a lady called Maggie Eales in London to whom I sent a demo tape of me reading the evening news at KTN. She passed in on to a woman who changed my life. Rena Golden, the head of talent and programming at CNN International based in London.</p><p>Once I received Renaâ€™s email, I wouldnâ€™t stop sending notes. The first time she emailed me, she told me that I looked good on camera but I had no real journalism experience and that I was more of an academic from what she could tell from my CV.</p><p>I responded saying that was not the case and I had done some very serious journalism for BBC radio. I offered to send her some scripts I had written under the guidance of senior producers in London. One of them was a thirty minute script on the deregistration of NGOs after the US embassy bombing in Kenya.</p><p>Rena agreed and I sent her every intelligent script I had written. She went silent for a long time and I mustered up the gall to send her another note. There were more that went by with no response.</p><p>At the same time I had been planning a trip to the United States to see a young man I was dating. In a breakthrough email to Rena, I said I was â€œcoming to Atlanta anywayâ€ and could she â€œplease give me a screen test. â€œ My thinking was that I could use a piece of video with myself anchoring at CNN as part of another demo tape to send to another news organization. That was the best-case scenario for me professionally and personally I would have a wonderful time and spend a few days in Charleston and Savannah with my beau.</p><p>Rena replied saying something along these lines: â€œI am not hiring you, I will not give you a job, I will not pay for your ticket or your accommodation, but you can come if you want to and at your expense. I will give you a screen test.â€</p><p>I couldnâ€™t stop screaming with delight when I received that. I read every newspaper, every magazine I could, I watched the news on various channels, and then it came to the night before the trip. I had a crisis of confidence.</p><p>â€œWhy am I even bothering,â€ I cried to my mum, â€œsheâ€™s told me sheâ€™s not hiring me.â€</p><p>â€œJust go,â€ urged my mum. â€œDo it. Youâ€™ve come so farâ€</p><p>â€œBut itâ€™s a waste. Look how expensive this ticket is. Itâ€™s almost all my savings. Why am I even thinking I can do this? I donâ€™t even know what Iâ€™m doing. I canâ€™t do it.â€</p><p>â€œYes you can,â€ repeated mum over again. I doubted myself all night. I pulled myself together and then next day I caught the flight out from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi to Atlanta via Amsterdam.</p><p>At this point in my life I was feeling like a was a new person. I had suffered for many years from a skin disease called psoriasis, and survived an extreme form of its manifestation. My skin was exciting and clear for the first time in my young adult life and my mother had a beautiful strapless red dress made for me for when I met the man I was seeing for a lovely dinner. It was liberating to realize I could wear anything without stress or flakes of scales falling.</p><p>I will never forget walking though the red and blue exterior of the CNN building, the huge letters sitting outside and the park and parking deck around it. My palms sweated and my hands shook but my eyes sparkled with anticipation. I took at deep breath and asked for Rena Golden at the front desk.</p><p>Minutes later, she arrived, with a mane of black hair, a sharp suit no make up and a no nonsense attitude. She shook my hand briskly and whisked me up the escalator and left into the CNN International Newsroom.</p><p>I recall thinking how confident she was, I remember how she smiled at me reassuringly and how she communicated crisply and clearly. Rena walked me to the center of the newsroom and introduced me to Dan Williams, the head of writers, who was going to give me a general knowledge news quiz and also test my ability to â€œwrite news copy from news wires.â€ I had no idea what exactly that meant but I nodded and smiled nervously.</p><p>The quiz was basic and I handled it with ease. Then Dan gave me stories printed out from Reuters and the Associated Press and asked me to use that information to write the scripts that TV anchors read on air. I had never done this before but I managed to pull something off after about one hour.</p><p>Rena walked over and took me to a smaller studio. She told me she would ask me to read the prompter, conduct an interview and finally, handle a breaking news scenario. She said she would be â€œin my earâ€ meaning I would be able to hear her from an earpiece that I had just learned to wear.</p><p>Reading large white words rolling up a black screen was easy, though my mouth was dry. In the second go-around, the words suddenly disappeared as if someone had pressed delete. I looked down and picked up the sentence easily off the hard copy of paper scripts in front of me, and continued without missing a beat.</p><p>Next was a fake interview with the Israeli Prime Minster. Rena pretended to be him. She outlined the scenario and I asked a few basic questions to which she responded. I was no political expert, especially with the complexity of the Israeli â€“ Palestinian conflict, so I kept my questions very basic, common sense, and didnâ€™t try do any intellectual acrobatics.</p><p>Then it was time for breaking news. Jeff Marcowsky,a director in the CNN control room, had winked at me before I went into the studio and said â€œplane crashâ€. Brad Rhoads, a supervisor had also laughed about the same. I had my first inside tip.</p><p>Sure enough, Rena described the scene of a plane crash and asked me to do an interview with a reporter on the scene and to ad-lib about the crash. It was hard but I was having a fun once I settled into it and my adrenalin was racing.</p><p>At the end of the screen test she came in and asked â€œhow long are you here for?â€</p><p>â€œA couple more hours,â€ I said.</p><p>â€œCome and see me before you leaveâ€</p><p>â€œDonâ€™t forget a copy of the screen test on tape,â€ I reminded her.</p><p>In the time I was there I met with three additional players at CNN at the time, Riz Khan, an anchor of the famous Q&amp;A talk show. Riz was extremely warm and very funny. Steve Cassidy and Parisa Khosravi on the international desk, the heartbeat of a news operation that gathers the news, each met and talked to me. I asked many questions hoping that I would learn as much as possible in the little time I was going to be at CNN.</p><p>When it was it was time to leave, I went to see Rena to say goodbye and get my tape.</p><p>â€œWhy donâ€™t you come in for a chatâ€ she said. I entered her corner office and sat down across from her in a comfortable black chair.</p><p>â€œWhat nationality are you,?â€ she asked.</p><p>â€œKenyan,â€ I responded.</p><p>I will never ever forget the next lines she said to me. Till this day, it is one of the highlights of my life.</p><p>â€œIâ€™m going to do something Iâ€™ve never done before. Iâ€™m going to offer you a job right now. I know where you have been the past few hours, I know who you have met with. I like how persistent youâ€™ve been. Thatâ€™s that kind of person I want at CNN.â€</p><p>I stared at her, slowly beginning to understand what she was saying.</p><p>â€œWhat?â€</p><p>She smiled. â€œYou donâ€™t have to respond right now. Take some time to think about it.â€</p><p>â€œYes!â€ I said. â€œI accept!â€ I wanted to jump up and down like crazy.</p><p>â€œI will hire you as a writer/producerâ€ she said. â€œWe will teach you the basic building blocks of television news. Iâ€™ll give you anchoring opportunities and if you do well I will promote you as a full time anchor. If not, you can continue to write and produce in the newsroom and then return to Kenya after that.â€</p><p>It was incredible. I went to the hotel I was staying at, the Marriot Marquis in downtown Atlanta, and called home. My parents didnâ€™t quite believe me at first. My father cried. We were all in total shock.</p><p>I returned to Kenya a week later, and played the song â€œMidnight Train to Georgiaâ€ by Gladys Knight every day on my mid-morning radio show on 94.4 Capital FM, and no one could figure out why I suddenly loved it so much.</p>','<p>Rena</p><p>It was 1999 and I was hosting the mid morning show on Capital FM radio in Nairobi, anchoring the KTN news at night, and stringing for the BBC world service putting together more serious pieces. I had made a shift from entertainment only to hard news instantly when I saw the black smoke rise from the window on the nineteenth floor of Lohnro House in down town Nairobi on August 7, 1998.</p><p>The time was 10:38am. That was the moment the US embassy in Nairobi was attacked by terrorists. I was on the air. I remember how the building shook and how I thought it must be an earthquake. I remember watching a bearded American journalist for CNN reporting on the story a day later. His name was Jerrold Kessel. I never imagined I would one day be interviewing him on the air, as his anchor.</p><p>Months later at our home in Parklands, I was watching CNN one evening. I got it in my head â€œI can do that.â€ I tend to act quickly and relentlessly when I want something badly.

This one mission was going to deliver more money than they would see in a lifetime of slogging but the danger, and the stakes were high.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was no margin for error inside this pod where technology was the most lethal and the most spectacular. Each had accepted there would be no contact with any one in the outside world for fear of slipping up, sending a signal that could lead to discovery and disaster.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Each had proven their mental strength and almost warped ability to block out the world of lattes, bills, cafes and movies, to stifle emotion and desire, and refusal to trust, except perhaps, each other. They were in it together, embracing a life of falsehoods that hid behind the shattered tapestry of their own lives.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They tolerated the tight dirty brown cubicles, the cold coffees, overflowing ashtrays, crushed soda cans and stale pizza, the daily dinner, always frozen and stocked up for the week. Tense faces and urgent voices rose suddenly breaking the bleary-eyed methodical typing and mapping.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;â€œTo the left moreâ€</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;â€œI canâ€™t keep up, sheâ€™s moving faster.â€</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;â€œJust step on it will you.â€</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;â€œSheâ€™s changing course, good, slowing down.

Yet I have spent a lifetime hiding.</p><p>For years, I guard a painful secret: I can\'t bear to look in the mirror. I shrink from bright light. A gaze that lingers a second too long makes me panic. A hot summer day sends me into the shadows.</p><p>I have fish-like scales. There are tiny red islands floating on the surface of my skin. They combine to create continents with jagged surfaces. They turn black and start to smell. There is blood and pus.</p><p>My scalp spits out silver flakes. My ears are filled with crusts. I leave white specks wherever I sit. I float in long, loose clothes. My hands betray me. The sores sit openly. My nails are dented with pockmarks. I find strands of hair on the sheets and pillowcases every morning.</p><p>I suffer from psoriasis. It\'s ravaged my body since I was 8. At its worst my plaques look like leprosy. I feel like a leper.</p><p>\"Please can you leave the pool,\" a woman once told me when I was 22, visiting the Dead Sea in Israel, \"we\'re not comfortable with you in it.\" She is horrified at my body. I am ashamed. I hang my head.</p><p>The landscape from my neck down is chaos.</p><p>So I choose to look away. I am able to dress perfectly in the dark. I can feel my way around a room or a closet full of clothes. I instinctively choose the dimmest corner of a restaurant to sit in. Winters are a relief only because I won\'t stand out covered from top to toe.</p><p>My face is flawless. Not a blemish. Not a mark. Compliments are endless. But I am acutely aware that a horror film unfolds in secret beneath my clothes. I am effervescent and radiant on the outside and rotting inside. Which is the real me?</p><p>The cameras fire up, the red light turns on. I am splendidly made up. I lose myself in the moment. I am energized. I am focused. It\'s only my face. It is floating. It\'s all that exists. It gives me confidence.</p><p>No one has it all. I fight my body and myself all my life. I hit rock bottom many times because of my disease. It seems futile to try anymore. \"Who will ever want me like this\" I cry hysterically at home. \"No one could ever touch me.\" My mother pulls me out self-loathing and defeatism. When I want to give up, she will not let me.</p><p>She becomes an expert on psoriasis. She reads medical journals and approaches alternative healers. She takes me for acupuncture and hypnosis. She mixes various acids in a lab for me to use on my skin and soaks me in a tub full of Dead Sea salt. The rest of the day, I am in a messy, smelly cream. Endless personal research, trial and error bring occasional relief.</p><p>Imagine the nightmarish teen years. I cower from close friendships. No one can know the truth. I never date. Intimacy is out of the question. I have no sensation of touch. The scales are too thick.</p><p>The itch is unbearable. I try and ignore it. It\'s impossible. It agitates me. I use all my strength and I tear at my skin. I am violent. I scratch back and forth until there is blood. It is too raw to do any more. I am filled with rage and humiliated.</p><p>So I disappear in my head, create fictional stories and characters. I play out entire conversations, lives and deaths, stories of courage and cowardice to escape myself.

The floor manager cues me. The lights on, news copy in my hands, I smile and welcome millions of Kenyans into the studio.</p><p>The contrast is sharp -- behind closed doors, I have given up.

I wasnâ€™t talking about you! Iâ€™m sure your mom is very pleasant!â€ I call after them but theyâ€™ve already scampered down the hall, probably to the safety of the freshman hall.</p><p>Someone in the office must be playing around with me, because they paired me up with the smartest and most science obsessed kid in the entire school. I was just looking for a nerd that I could charm with a smile and a low-cut top here in there to give me all the answers to my next Chem test.</p><p>JP Carlson was definitely NOT going to be that person for me. Although I had never really talked to JP, he has a reputation of being a pompous know-it-all that was also positively incorruptible . Apparently, one conversation with him will leave you feeling like a stupid monkey that hasnâ€™t been blessed by evolutionâ€”his words, not mine. This kid would take one look at my Chemistry grade and laugh me all the way to summer schoolâ€”or worse a 5th year of high school. I quickly turned back to the office and marched to the front desk.</p><p>â€œExcuse me,â€ I said to the girl sitting at the desk, â€œI think there has been some kind of mistake.â€ I handed her my paper and she glanced it over. â€œThere is no mistake,â€ she said and returned my paper, â€œJP is the tutor that covers all junior science cases.â€ Cases? What the hell? Iâ€™m not a junkie or something! Iâ€™m just a dummy that canâ€™t grasp the fundamentals of Chemistry! â€œUmâ€¦ok then. Sorry.â€ I replied, took my paper, and left the office. Guess I really am going to have to be humiliated in front of the smartest kid in all South Carolina.</p><p>I warily made my way to the library secretly hoping JP was too busy working on the next nuclear reactor or some shit to bother tutoring me.</p><p>No such luck.</p><p>He was sitting at one of the round tables near the windows with piles of chemistry books surrounding him, looking at the books like they were Legoâ€™s and he was a three-year old kid that couldnâ€™t wait to play with them.</p><p>â€œWhatâ€¦aâ€¦WEIRDOâ€ I muttered and plastered a fake smile on my face as I walked up to him.</p><p>â€œHi JP, Iâ€™m Charlie.â€</p><p>He looked up at me and flashed the most beautiful smile I have ever seen on any human being that isnâ€™t Ryan Gosling. I looked at him closely then realized that Mr. Supernerd is actually a Superhottie!</p><p>â€œHi Charlie,â€ he said, the beautiful smile still on his face, â€œyouâ€™re ten minutes late.â€ Needles to say that winning smile disappeared in a heart beat and it was kind of sad to see if go.</p><p>He motioned to the seat next to him and I plopped down rolling my eyes. I was tempted tell him I didnâ€™t want him to tutor me and was desperately trying to get rid of him, but decided against it. Itâ€™s bad enough that the nerd/hottie has to help me with chemistry and that he thinks I donâ€™t have the mental capacity to tell time. No point adding, â€˜rude bitchâ€™ to the laundry list of my apparent flaws.</p><p>â€œSo why are you here Charlie?â€ he asked after I finally pulled all my stuff from my bag.</p><p>Is this kid serious? I clearly need help in Chemistry.</p><p>â€œWellâ€¦umâ€¦I suck at Chemistry and would really prefer to graduate with the rest of the kids my age. So I need help,â€ I said trying to hide the irritation in my voice.</p><p>â€œWell thatâ€™s excellent!â€ He exclaimed adjusting his glasses (which totally hid these gorgeous grey eyes), â€œYou are motivated and willing to take the initiative to improve your grade and your study skills.â€ I stared at him in disbelief.</p><p>Seriously kid, who are you? Motivation? Initiative? You sound like one of those inspirational posters they hang in the counseling office.</p><p>â€œYea sure whatever,â€ I said tapping my pencil anxiously, â€œCan we get started? I have to meet up with my friends in an hour.â€</p><p>â€œFriends can wait, Charlie. However, your performance in your chemistry class cannot afford to be ignored any longer. This tutoring session cannot wait.â€ JP said quietly.</p><p>Ok, I donâ€™t care how hot this kid might be, he is really getting on my nerves. So I decided to get back at him at bit.</p><p>â€œJP, lemme ask you something.â€</p><p>â€œYes?â€ he asked, probably assuming I was going to ask him about photosynthesis or some sciencey shit like that.</p><p>â€œWhat do you do for fun? Like real fun, besides building models of atoms or stuff like that?â€ I asked.</p><p>â€œThat question is irrelevant to this study session. If you want to ask me something about chemistry then I have an answer for you.â€ He retorted.</p><p>â€œIt was just a simple questionâ€ I muttered flipping through my chemistry bookâ€”it looked like gibberish to me.</p><p>â€œOk,â€ he said, â€œWell I have a simple question for you.â€</p><p>â€œGo ahead. Iâ€™m an open book. Pun intendedâ€ I replied glibly, motioning to the open book in front of me.</p><p>I could tell he wanted to laugh at my cheesy joke but decided to say â€œprofessionalâ€</p><p>â€œWhy are you really here? I looked at you transcript and chemistry is not the only class you are struggling in. Youâ€™ve pulled up your other grades from earlier this semester, but something doesnâ€™t make sense. You were a fairly good student before Christmas break and all of a sudden your grades plummet. What happened over Christmas break?â€ he asked.</p><p>Oh I donâ€™t knowâ€¦lets think. Well first I lied to my best friends, nearly got them arrested and all of that just to lose the love of my life to my childhood arch nemesis. Nopeâ€¦nothing of significance that would cause my grades to fall. But there is no way in hell Iâ€™m telling Mr. Smarty Pants all that though.</p><p>â€œLook, itâ€™s really cute that you care and everything,â€ I said slamming my book closed and standing up, â€œBut I did not sign up for a counseling session. So if you want to go all Oprah circa 2004 on me, I can leave.â€</p><p>â€œCharlie sit down,â€ JP said, standing up as well. â€œI didnâ€™t mean to upset you. You obviously donâ€™t want to talk about it so letâ€™s just keep this professional and leave the personal questions outside of the tutoring sessions? OK?â€</p><p>Outside of tutoring sessions? Does he think weâ€™re going to become besties and talk about our life problems? I think not.</p><p>â€œFineâ€¦â€I muttered. â€œBut the only reason Iâ€™m staying is because being on the five-year plan is really not a good look for anyone.â€</p>','<p>I glance down at the paper in my hand and stare in shock.</p><p>â€œSonofabitch!â€ I yell, scaring a tiny freshman that happened to be walking right by me.</p><p>â€œSorry!

This kid would take one look at my Chemistry grade and laugh me all the way to summer schoolâ€”or worse a 5th year of high school. I quickly turned back to the office and marched to the front desk.</p><p>â€œExcuse me,â€ I said to the girl sitting at the desk, â€œI think there has been some kind of mistake.â€ I handed her my paper and she glanced it over. â€œThere is no mistake,â€ she said and returned my paper, â€œJP is the tutor that covers all junior science cases.â€ Cases? What the hell? Iâ€™m not a junkie or something! Iâ€™m just a dummy that canâ€™t grasp the fundamentals of Chemistry! â€œUmâ€¦ok then. Sorry.â€ I replied, took my paper, and left the office. Guess I really am going to have to be humiliated in front of the smartest kid in all South Carolina.</p><p>I warily made my way to the library secretly hoping JP was too busy working on the next nuclear reactor or some shit to bother tutoring me.</p><p>No such luck.</p><p>He was sitting at one of the round tables near the windows with piles of chemistry books surrounding him, looking at the books like they were Legoâ€™s and he was a three-year old kid that couldnâ€™t wait to play with them.</p><p>â€œWhatâ€¦aâ€¦WEIRDOâ€ I muttered and plastered a fake smile on my face as I walked up to him.</p><p>â€œHi JP, Iâ€™m Charlie.â€</p><p>He looked up at me and flashed the most beautiful smile I have ever seen on any human being that isnâ€™t Ryan Gosling. I looked at him closely then realized that Mr. Supernerd is actually a Superhottie!</p><p>â€œHi Charlie,â€ he said, the beautiful smile still on his face, â€œyouâ€™re ten minutes late.â€ Needles to say that winning smile disappeared in a heart beat and it was kind of sad to see if go.</p><p>He motioned to the seat next to him and I plopped down rolling my eyes. I was tempted tell him I didnâ€™t want him to tutor me and was desperately trying to get rid of him, but decided against it. Itâ€™s bad enough that the nerd/hottie has to help me with chemistry and that he thinks I donâ€™t have the mental capacity to tell time. No point adding, â€˜rude bitchâ€™ to the laundry list of my apparent flaws.</p><p>â€œSo why are you here Charlie?â€ he asked after I finally pulled all my stuff from my bag.</p><p>Is this kid serious? I clearly need help in Chemistry.</p><p>â€œWellâ€¦umâ€¦I suck at Chemistry and would really prefer to graduate with the rest of the kids my age. So I need help,â€ I said trying to hide the irritation in my voice.</p><p>â€œWell thatâ€™s excellent!â€ He exclaimed adjusting his glasses (which totally hid these gorgeous grey eyes), â€œYou are motivated and willing to take the initiative to improve your grade and your study skills.â€ I stared at him in disbelief.</p><p>Seriously kid, who are you? Motivation? Initiative? You sound like one of those inspirational posters they hang in the counseling office.</p><p>â€œYea sure whatever,â€ I said tapping my pencil anxiously, â€œCan we get started? I have to meet up with my friends in an hour.â€</p><p>â€œFriends can wait, Charlie. However, your performance in your chemistry class cannot afford to be ignored any longer. This tutoring session cannot wait.â€ JP said quietly.</p><p>Ok, I donâ€™t care how hot this kid might be, he is really getting on my nerves. So I decided to get back at him at bit.</p><p>â€œJP, lemme ask you something.â€</p><p>â€œYes?â€ he asked, probably assuming I was going to ask him about photosynthesis or some sciencey shit like that.</p><p>â€œWhat do you do for fun? Like real fun, besides building models of atoms or stuff like that?â€ I asked.</p><p>â€œThat question is irrelevant to this study session. If you want to ask me something about chemistry then I have an answer for you.â€ He retorted.</p><p>â€œIt was just a simple questionâ€ I muttered flipping through my chemistry bookâ€”it looked like gibberish to me.</p><p>â€œOk,â€ he said, â€œWell I have a simple question for you.â€</p><p>â€œGo ahead. Iâ€™m an open book. Pun intendedâ€ I replied glibly, motioning to the open book in front of me.</p><p>I could tell he wanted to laugh at my cheesy joke but decided to say â€œprofessionalâ€</p><p>â€œWhy are you really here? I looked at you transcript and chemistry is not the only class you are struggling in. Youâ€™ve pulled up your other grades from earlier this semester, but something doesnâ€™t make sense. You were a fairly good student before Christmas break and all of a sudden your grades plummet. What happened over Christmas break?â€ he asked.</p><p>Oh I donâ€™t knowâ€¦lets think. Well first I lied to my best friends, nearly got them arrested and all of that just to lose the love of my life to my childhood arch nemesis. Nopeâ€¦nothing of significance that would cause my grades to fall. But there is no way in hell Iâ€™m telling Mr. Smarty Pants all that though.</p><p>â€œLook, itâ€™s really cute that you care and everything,â€ I said slamming my book closed and standing up, â€œBut I did not sign up for a counseling session. So if you want to go all Oprah circa 2004 on me, I can leave.â€</p><p>â€œCharlie sit down,â€ JP said, standing up as well. â€œI didnâ€™t mean to upset you. You obviously donâ€™t want to talk about it so letâ€™s just keep this professional and leave the personal questions outside of the tutoring sessions? OK?â€</p><p>Outside of tutoring sessions? Does he think weâ€™re going to become besties and talk about our life problems? I think not.</p><p>â€œFineâ€¦â€I muttered. â€œBut the only reason Iâ€™m staying is because being on the five-year plan is really not a good look for anyone.â€</p>','/content/images/2015/05/chemistry.jpg',0,0,'published','en_US',NULL,NULL,NULL,'\n                            &nbsp;First portion of a chapter of a young-adult novel I\'ve been writing for years.\n                        ',5,'2015-05-09 19:24:04',2,'2015-05-13 01:54:58',2,'2015-05-09 19:24:20',1,0),(18,'e199fdb3-aeb1-4064-ab17-ef9ede14a69d','This is a test','this-is-a-test','<p><b>So...things are about to take off with aKoma. <i>Gentlewomen, gentlemen</i>...START YOUR ENGINES!!!</b></p>','<p><b>So...things are about to take off with aKoma. <i>Gentlewomen, gentlemen</i>...START YOUR ENGINES!!!</b></p>',NULL,0,0,'published','en_US',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,8,'2015-05-13 12:10:33',8,'2015-05-13 12:10:33',8,'2015-05-13 12:10:33',8,0),(19,'84b6a2a1-1368-416e-80c6-32ab75bfd3da','Travelouges','travelouges-2','<p>Start writing your story here...</p>','<p>Start writing your story here...</p>','/content/images/2015/05/vintage-suitcase-table-via-texas_inetgiant.jpg',0,0,'published','en_US',NULL,NULL,NULL,'\n                            I\'ve always wanted to travel the world and be able to see as many countries as possible.
